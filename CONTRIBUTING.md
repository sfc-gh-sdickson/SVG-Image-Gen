# Contributing to SVG Image Generator

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the SVG Image Generator project! This document provides guidelines and workflows for contributors.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Fork and clone** the repository
2. **Set up your development environment** (see [Development Setup](#development-setup))
3. **Create a feature branch** for your changes
4. **Make your changes** following our [coding standards](#coding-standards)
5. **Test your changes** thoroughly
6. **Submit a pull request**

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- A Snowflake account (for testing)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-fork-url>
   cd SVG-Image-Gen
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Using pip (recommended for most users)
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

   # Or using uv (faster, more reliable)
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

3. **Set up pre-commit hooks:**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp config.example.env .env
   # Edit .env with your Snowflake credentials
   ```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Type Checking and Stub Management

We use **mypy** for static type checking. To ensure all dependencies have proper type stubs:

#### Automatic Stub Management

We provide a helper script that automatically detects missing type stubs and adds them to `requirements-dev.txt`:

```bash
# Run the script to detect and fix missing type stubs
python scripts/fix-missing-type-stubs.py
```

This script will:
- Run mypy on your codebase
- Detect missing type stubs
- Add the correct `types-<package>` dependencies to `requirements-dev.txt`
- Optionally install the new stubs

#### Manual Stub Management

If you prefer to handle stubs manually:

1. **Run mypy** to see missing stubs:
   ```bash
   mypy src/
   ```

2. **Add missing stubs** to `requirements-dev.txt`:
   ```txt
   types-requests
   types-PyYAML
   # etc.
   ```

3. **Install the stubs:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Our pre-commit configuration automatically:
- **Fixes missing type stubs** before each commit
- **Formats code** with black and isort
- **Lints code** with ruff and flake8
- **Checks types** with mypy
- **Runs security checks** with bandit

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test categories
pytest -m "unit"      # Unit tests only
pytest -m "integration"  # Integration tests only
pytest -m "snowflake"    # Snowflake-specific tests

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src/svg_image_generator --cov-report=html
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
black src/ tests/
isort src/ tests/

# Lint code
ruff check src/ tests/
flake8 src/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy src/

# Security checks
bandit -r src/
```

## 📝 Coding Standards

### Python Code Style

- **Follow PEP 8** with line length of 88 characters (black default)
- **Use type hints** for all function parameters and return values
- **Write docstrings** for all public functions and classes
- **Use meaningful variable names** and avoid abbreviations

### Example

```python
from typing import Optional, List
from pathlib import Path

def process_svg_files(directory: Path, max_files: Optional[int] = None) -> List[str]:
    """
    Process SVG files in the given directory.

    Args:
        directory: Path to the directory containing SVG files
        max_files: Maximum number of files to process (None for all)

    Returns:
        List of processed file paths

    Raises:
        ValueError: If directory doesn't exist
    """
    if not directory.exists():
        raise ValueError(f"Directory {directory} does not exist")

    svg_files = list(directory.glob("*.svg"))
    if max_files:
        svg_files = svg_files[:max_files]

    return [str(f) for f in svg_files]
```

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Examples:
- `feat(auth): add dual authentication support`
- `fix(pre-commit): remove deprecated yml type from prettier config`
- `docs(readme): add uv installation instructions`
- `test(authentication): add tests for local environment setup`

### Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Create a descriptive title** that summarizes the change
2. **Write a detailed description** explaining what and why
3. **Include tests** for new functionality
4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Ensure all checks pass** (CI, pre-commit, tests)

## 🔐 Authentication and Environment

### Local Development

For local development, you need to set up environment variables:

```bash
# Required
SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=your-account-identifier
SNOWFLAKE_USER=your-username
SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=your-password
SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE=your-warehouse-name

# Optional
SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE=your-database-name
SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA=your-schema-name
SNOWFLAKE_ROLE=your-role-name
```

### Streamlit in Snowflake (SiS)

When deployed in Snowflake, the application automatically uses your active session - no additional configuration needed.

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions and classes
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-end tests**: Test complete workflows
- **Snowflake tests**: Test Snowflake-specific functionality

### Test Naming

```python
def test_function_name_with_expected_behavior():
    """Test description of what is being tested."""
    # Arrange
    # Act
    # Assert
```

### Mocking

Use `pytest-mock` for mocking:

```python
def test_function_with_mock(mocker):
    mock_session = mocker.patch('snowflake.snowpark.Session')
    # Test implementation
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Local Testing

```bash
streamlit run SVG-Image-Gen.py
```

### Production Deployment

1. **Deploy to Streamlit in Snowflake (SiS)**
2. **Configure environment variables** in Snowflake
3. **Test the deployment** thoroughly

## Business Authority Principles

Before contributing, understand this project's core principle: **The business owns the business**.

### Platform Safety vs Business Authority

Many enterprise platforms (including Snowflake) implement "safety" features that are actually designed to protect the platform's liability, not your business interests. These can accidentally expand compliance/IT authority at the expense of business agility.

**Key principles for contributors:**
- Platform safety rules protect the vendor, not your business
- Don't cede business control to compliance/IT by default
- Understand the difference between platform constraints and business needs
- Business agility is essential for making money

### The CISO Problem:
Platform safety rules can degrade the respect and power that accrues to a sensible CISO. If your CISO is just a cop enforcing vendor-imposed restrictions, how is that helpful? A good CISO should be a strategic business partner who understands risk in business terms, not just a rule enforcer for platform vendors.

### Examples in this codebase:
- Runtime detection prevents operations that could expose Snowflake to liability
- SQL scripts use `REVOKE CURRENT GRANTS` because Snowflake wants bulletproof audit trails
- These are platform-protective measures, not user-protective features

**When contributing:**
- Question whether "safety" rules actually serve business interests
- Don't assume platform constraints are user-friendly
- Maintain business control while working within platform constraints
- Avoid accidental compliance creep
- Don't let platform rules turn your CISO into just another cop
